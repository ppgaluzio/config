abstract = {We investigate the effect of drag force on the enstrophy cascade of two-dimensional Navier-Stokes turbulence. We find a power law decrease of the energy wave number (k) spectrum that is faster than the classical (no-drag) prediction of k(-3). It is shown that the enstrophy cascade with drag can be analyzed by making use of a previous theory for finite lifetime passive scalars advected by a Lagrangian chaotic fluid flow. Using this we relate the power law exponent of the energy wave number spectrum to the distribution of finite time Lyapunov exponents and the drag coefficient.},

Here, we prove that an FSLE ridge satisfying certain conditions does signal a nearby ridge of some Finite-Time Lyapunov Exponent (FTLE) field, which in turn indicates a hyperbolic LCS under further conditions. Other FSLE ridges violating our conditions, however, are seen to be false positives for LCSs. We also find further limitations of the FSLE in Lagrangian coherence detection, including ill-posedness, artificial jump-discontinuities, and sensitivity with respect to the computational time step.},

abstract = {Abstract It is determined how long a time series must be to estimate covariances and moments up to fourth order with a specified statistical significance. For a given averaging time T there is a systematic difference between the true flux or moment and the ensemble average of the time means of the same quantities. This difference, referred to here as the systematic error, is a decreasing function of T tending to zero for T→∞. The variance of the time mean of the flux or moment, the so-called error variance, represents the random scatter of individual realizations, which, when T is much larger than the integral time scale T of the time series, is also a decreasing function of T. This makes it possible to assess the minimum value of T necessary to obtain systematic and random errors smaller than specified values. Assuming that the time series are either Gaussian processes with exponential correlation functions or a skewed process derived from a Gaussian, we obtain expressions for the systematic and random e...},

abstract = {The poor expression of Plasmodium falciparum proteins in heterologous systems and the difficulty in obtaining sufficient material directly from the parasite have limited the experimental characterization of many of the approximately 5200 proteins encoded by this organism. To improve the expression of P. falciparum proteins in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we selected yeast ura3 mutants that acquired the ability to utilize the P. falciparum orthologue (PfOMPDC) of URA3 to grow on media lacking uracil. Two of these mutant strains, BY{\#}29 and PJ{\#}17, expressed up to 100-fold more of four P. falciparum proteins as a result of mutations in either HRP1 or KAP104, respectively. These mutations, as well as a temperature-sensitive rna15 mutation, likely decrease the efficiency of mRNA 3' end formation and produce longer mRNAs of P. falciparum genes. These yeast strains may be useful for the analysis and purification of P. falciparum proteins.},

@article{Zhao2009,
abstract = {Cellular interactions with extracellular matrix play essential roles in tumor initiation, progression and metastasis. Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase identified as a key mediator of signaling by integrins, a major family of cell surface receptors for extracellular matrix, as well as other receptors in both normal and cancer cells. FAK is activated by integrins through disruption of an auto-inhibitory intra-molecular interaction between its kinase domain and the amino terminal FERM domain. The activated FAK forms a binary complex with Src family kinases which can phosphorylate other substrates and trigger multiple intracellular signaling pathways to regulate various cellular functions. Subcellular localization of FAK in focal adhesions is essential for FAK signaling, which is another distinguishing feature of the kinase. Integrin-FAK signaling has been shown to activate a number of signaling pathways through phosphorylation and protein-protein interactions to promote tumorigenesis. FAK also plays a prominent role in tumor progression and metastasis through its regulation of both cancer cells and their microenvironments including cancer cell migration, invasion, epithelial to mesenchymal transition, and angiogenesis. More recently, a role for FAK in tumor initiation and progression has been demonstrated directly using xenograft as well as conditional knockout mouse models. In agreement with these experimental data, overexpression and activation of FAK have been found in a variety of human cancers. A number of small molecule inhibitors for FAK have been developed and in various phases of testing for cancer treatments. Overall, the intensive research on FAK signaling in cancer have yielded a wealth of information on this pivotal kinase and these and future studies are leading to potentially novel therapies for cancer.},

The spatial structure of the turbulent flux is analyzed, indicating radially elongated structures (streamers) at the low field side which are distorted by magnetic shear at different toroidal positions. The interplay between self-generated zonal flows and transport events is investigated, resulting in significant modifications of the frequency and the amplitude of bursts. The propagation of bursts is studied in the presence of a transport barrier generated by a strong shear flow.},

abstract = {In this paper we examine the coupling of two wave triplets sharing two common modes. The analysis is performed in the solitonic sector of the parameter space where uncoupled solutions departing from linearly unstable homogeneous initial conditions evolve into a collection of regularly interspersed, spatiotemporally localized spikes. The uncoupled system is integrable, but coupling destroys integrability. As coupling grows, energy transfer to smaller spatial scales does appear and becomes faster not only in linearly unstable, but also in linearly stable cases. Chaos in low-dimensional subsystems appears to be responsible for the transfer. We perform a series of numerical tests to verify this idea.},

abstract = {In this paper, we numerically investigate the fraction of nonhyperbolic parameter values in chaotic dynamical systems. By a nonhyperbolic parameter value we mean a panmeter value at which there are tangencies between some stable and unstable manifolds. The nonhyperbolic parameter values are h p o m t because the dynamics in such cases is especially pathological. For example, near each such parameter value, there is another parameter value at which there are infinitely many coexisting amctors. In particular, Newhouse and Robinson proved that the existence of one nonhyperbolic parameter value typidy implies the existence of an interval (‘a Newhouse interval') of nonhyperbolic parameter values. We numerically compute the fraction of nonhyperbolic parameter values for the Henon map in Ihe parameter range .where there exist only chaotic saddles (i.e., nonamcting invariant chaotic sets). We discuss a theoretical model which predias the fraction of nonhyperbolic parameter values for small Jacobians. Two-dimensional diffeomorphisms with similar chaotic saddles may arise in the study of Poincar6 rem map for physical systems. Ow results suggest that (1) nonhyperbolic chaotic saddles am common in chaotic dynamical systems: and (2) Newhouse intervals can be quite large in the parameter space.},

We construct several sets computationally easier to deal with than the construction of resonances, based on the ordering properties for orbits of twist maps. Furthermore these sets can be constructed for four- and higher-dimensional twist mappings. For the four-dimensional case-using the example of Froeshle-we find "practically" invariant volumes surrounding elliptic fixed points. The boundaries of these regions are remarkably sharp; however, the regions are threaded by "tubes" of escaping orbits.},

abstract = {The transition to turbulence via spatiotemporal intermittency is investigated in the context of coupled maps defined on small-world networks. The local dynamics is given by the Chat{\'{e}}-Manneville minimal map previously used in studies of spatiotemporal intermittency in ordered lattice. The critical boundary separating laminar and turbulent regimes is calculated on the parameter space of the system, given by the coupling strength and the rewiring probability of the network. Windows of relaminarization are present in some regions of the parameter space. New features arise in small-world networks; for instance, the character of the transition to turbulence changes from second-order to a first-order phase transition at some critical value of the rewiring probability. A linear relation characterizing the change in the order of the phase transition is found. The global quantity used as order parameter for the transition also exhibits nontrivial collective behavior for some values of the parameters. These models may describe several processes occurring in nonuniform media where the degree of disorder can be continuously varied through a parameter.},

@article{Iwanski1998,
abstract = {A recurrence plot is a visualization tool for analyzing experimental data. These plots often reveal correlations in the data that are not easily detected in the original time series. Existing recurrence plot analysis techniques, which are primarily application oriented and completely quantitative, require that the time-series data first be embedded in a high-dimensional space, where the embedding dimension d(E) is dictated by the dimension d of the data set, with d(E){\textgreater}/=2d+1. One such set of recurrence plot analysis tools, recurrence quantification analysis, is particularly useful in finding locations in the data where the underlying dynamics change. We have found that for certain low-dimensional systems the same results can be obtained with no embedding. (c) 1998 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {In this paper we analyze a diffusion phenomenon in a few-dimensional Hamiltonian system of coupled mappings in which the principal component of diffusion occurs along resonances. The result is that the diffusion can have power-law dependence in coupling parameter mu and be independent of the stochastic parameter K. For the same range of parameters, the usual analytical Arnold diffusion across resonances is dependent on K and can be much smaller than resonance streaming diffusion. The results are used to qualitatively explain recent results in multidimensional coupled standard maps.},

abstract = {A comparative risk assessment of drugs including alcohol and tobacco using the margin of exposure (MOE) approach was conducted. The MOE is defined as ratio between toxicological threshold (benchmark dose) and estimated human intake. Median lethal dose values from animal experiments were used to derive the benchmark dose. The human intake was calculated for individual scenarios and population-based scenarios. The MOE was calculated using probabilistic Monte Carlo simulations. The benchmark dose values ranged from 2 mg/kg bodyweight for heroin to 531 mg/kg bodyweight for alcohol (ethanol). For individual exposure the four substances alcohol, nicotine, cocaine and heroin fall into the "high risk" category with MOE {\textless} 10, the rest of the compounds except THC fall into the "risk" category with MOE {\textless} 100. On a population scale, only alcohol would fall into the "high risk" category, and cigarette smoking would fall into the "risk" category, while all other agents (opiates, cocaine, amphetamine-type stimulants, ecstasy, and benzodiazepines) had MOEs {\textgreater} 100, and cannabis had a MOE {\textgreater} 10,000. The toxicological MOE approach validates epidemiological and social science-based drug ranking approaches especially in regard to the positions of alcohol and tobacco (high risk) and cannabis (low risk).},

@article{Angeli2004,
abstract = {It is becoming increasingly clear that bistability (or, more generally, multistability) is an important recurring theme in cell signaling. Bistability may be of particular relevance to biological systems that switch between discrete states, generate oscillatory responses, or "remember" transitory stimuli. Standard mathematical methods allow the detection of bistability in some very simple feedback systems (systems with one or two proteins or genes that either activate each other or inhibit each other), but realistic depictions of signal transduction networks are invariably much more complex. Here, we show that for a class of feedback systems of arbitrary order the stability properties of the system can be deduced mathematically from how the system behaves when feedback is blocked. Provided that this open-loop, feedback-blocked system is monotone and possesses a sigmoidal characteristic, the system is guaranteed to be bistable for some range of feedback strengths. We present a simple graphical method for deducing the stability behavior and bifurcation diagrams for such systems and illustrate the method with two examples taken from recent experimental studies of bistable systems: a two-variable Cdc2/Wee1 system and a more complicated five-variable mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade.},

abstract = {Half a century ago Hurst introduced Rescaled Range (R/S) Analysis to study fluctuations in time series. Thousands of works have investigated or applied the original methodology and similar techniques, with Detrended Fluctuation Analysis becoming preferred due to its purported ability to mitigate nonstationaries. We show Detrended Fluctuation Analysis introduces artifacts for nonlinear trends, in contrast to common expectation, and demonstrate that the empirically observed curvature induced is a serious finite-size effect which will always be present. Explicit detrending followed by measurement of the diffusional spread of a signals' associated random walk is preferable, a surprising conclusion given that Detrended Fluctuation Analysis was crafted specifically to replace this approach. The implications are simple yet sweeping: there is no compelling reason to apply Detrended Fluctuation Analysis as it 1) introduces uncontrolled bias; 2) is computationally more expensive than the unbiased estimator; and 3) cannot provide generic or useful protection against nonstationaries.},

abstract = {Nonlinear dispersive wave equations provide excellent examples of infinite dimensional dynamical systems which possess diverse and fascinating phenomena including solitary waves and wave trains, the generation and propagation of oscillations, the formation of singularities, the persistence of homoclinic orbits, the existence of temporally chaotic waves in deterministic systems, dispersive turbulence and the propagation of spatiotemporal chaos. Nonlinear dispersive waves occur throughout physical and natural systems wherever dissipation is weak. Important applications include nonlinear optics and long distance communication devices such as transoceanic optical fibers, waves in the atmosphere and the ocean, and turbulence in plasmas. Examples of nonlinear dispersive partial differential equations include the Korteweg-de Vries equation, nonlinear Klein-Gordon equations, nonlinear Schr{\"{o}}dinger equations, and many others. In this survey article, we choose a class of nonlinear Schr{\"{o}}dinger equations (NLS) as prototypal examples, and we use members of this class to illustrate the qualitative phenomena described above. Our viewpoint is one of partial differential equations on the one hand, and infinite dimensional dynamical systems on the other. In particular, we will emphasize global qualitative information about the solutions of these nonlinear partial differential equations which can be obtained with the methods and geometric perspectives of dynamical systems theory. The article begins with a brief description of a spectacular success in pde of this dynamical systems viewpoint — the complete understanding of the remarkable properties of the soliton through the realization that certain nonlinear wave equations are completely integrable Hamiltonian systems. This complete integrability follows from a deep connection between certain special nonlinear wave equations (such as the {\{}NLS{\}} equation with cubic non-linearity in one spatial dimension) and the linear spectral theory of certain differential operators (the “Zakharov-Shabat” or “Dirac” operator in the {\{}NLS{\}} case). From this connection the “inverse spectral transform” has been developed and used to represent integrable nonlinear waves. These representations have provided a full solution of the Cauchy initial value problem for several types of boundary conditions, a thorough understanding of the remarkable properties of the soliton, descriptions of quasi-periodic wave trains, and descriptions of the formation and propagation of oscillations as slowly varying nonlinear wave-trains. In addition, more recent developments are described, including:o(i) the formation of singularities and their relationship to dispersive turbulence; (ii) weak turbulence theory; (iii) the persistence of periodic, quasi-periodic, and homoclinic solutions, by methods including normal forms for pde's, Melnikov measurements, and geometric singular perturbation theory; (iv) temporal and spatiotemporal chaos; (v) long-time and small dispersion behavior of integrable waves through Riemann-Hilbert spectral methods. For each topic, the description is necessarily brief; however, references will be selected which should enable the interested reader to obtain more mathematical detail. },

abstract = {A turbulent flow is usually treated as a superposition of coherent structure and incoherent turbulence. In this paper, the largest Lyapunov exponent and the random noise in the near field of round jet and plane jet are estimated with our previously proposed method of chaotic time series analysis [T. L. Yao, et al., Chaos 22, 033102 (2012)]. The results show that the largest Lyapunov exponents of the round jet and plane jet are in direct proportion to the reciprocal of the integral time scale of turbulence, which is in accordance with the results of the dimensional analysis, and the proportionality coefficients are equal. In addition, the random noise of the round jet and plane jet has the same linear relation with the Kolmogorov velocity scale of turbulence. As a result, the random noise may well be from the incoherent disturbance in turbulence, and the coherent structure in turbulence may well follow the rule of chaotic motion.},

abstract = {Normally hyperbolic invariant manifolds (NHIMs) are well-known organizing centers of the dynamics in the phase space of a nonlinear system. Locating such manifolds in systems far from symmetric or integrable, however, has been an outstanding challenge. Here, we develop an automated detection method for codimension-one NHIMs in autonomous dynamical systems. Our method utilizes Stationary Lagrangian Coherent Structures (SLCSs), which are hypersurfaces satisfying one of the necessary conditions of a hyperbolic LCS, and are also quasi-invariant in a well-defined sense. Computing SLCSs provides a quick way to uncover NHIMs with high accuracy. As an illustration, we use SLCSs to locate two-dimensional stable and unstable manifolds of hyperbolic periodic orbits in the classic ABC flow, a three-dimensional solution of the steady Euler equations.},

abstract = {We study the development of coherent structures in local simulations of the magnetorotational instability in accretion discs in regimes of on-off intermittency. In a previous paper [Chian et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 104, 254102 (2010)], we have shown that the laminar and bursty states due to the on-off spatiotemporal intermittency in a one-dimensional model of nonlinear waves correspond, respectively, to nonattracting coherent structures with higher and lower degrees of amplitude-phase synchronization. In this paper we extend these results to a three-dimensional model of magnetized Keplerian shear flows. Keeping the kinetic Reynolds number and the magnetic Prandtl number fixed, we investigate two different intermittent regimes by varying the plasma beta parameter. The first regime is characterized by turbulent patterns interrupted by the recurrent emergence of a large-scale coherent structure known as two-channel flow, where the state of the system can be described by a single Fourier mode. The second regime is dominated by the turbulence with sporadic emergence of coherent structures with shapes that are reminiscent of a perturbed channel flow. By computing the Fourier power and phase spectral entropies in three-dimensions, we show that the large-scale coherent structures are characterized by a high degree of amplitude-phase synchronization.},

abstract = {Results are reported concerning the transition to chaos in random dynamical systems. In particular, situations are considered where a periodic attractor coexists with a nonattracting chaotic saddle, which can be expected in any periodic window of a nonlinear dynamical system. Under noise, the asymptotic attractor of the system can become chaotic, as characterized by the appearance of a positive Lyapunov exponent. Generic features of the transition include the following: (1) the noisy chaotic attractor is necessarily nonhyperbolic as there are periodic orbits embedded in it with distinct numbers of unstable directions (unstable dimension variability), and this nonhyperbolicity develops as soon as the attractor becomes chaotic; (2) for systems described by differential equations, the unstable dimension variability destroys the neutral direction of the flow in the sense that there is no longer a zero Lyapunov exponent after the noisy attractor becomes chaotic; and (3) the largest Lyapunov exponent becomes positive from zero in a continuous manner, and its scaling with the variation of the noise amplitude is algebraic. Formulas for the scaling exponent are derived in all dimensions. Numerical support using both low- and high-dimensional systems is provided.},

@article{Covas2001,
abstract = {We find concrete evidence for a recently discovered form of intermittency, referred to as in-out intermittency, in both partial differential equation (PDE) and ordinary differential equation (ODE) models of mean field dynamos. This type of intermittency [introduced in P. Ashwin, E. Covas, and R. Tavakol, Nonlinearity 9, 563 (1999)] occurs in systems with invariant submanifolds and, as opposed to on-off intermittency which can also occur in skew product systems, it requires an absence of skew product structure. By this we mean that the dynamics on the attractor intermittent to the invariant manifold cannot be expressed simply as the dynamics on the invariant subspace forcing the transverse dynamics; the transverse dynamics will alter that tangential to the invariant subspace when one is far enough away from the invariant manifold. Since general systems with invariant submanifolds are not likely to have skew product structure, this type of behavior may be of physical relevance in a variety of dynamical settings. The models employed here to demonstrate in-out intermittency are axisymmetric mean-field dynamo models which are often used to study the observed large-scale magnetic variability in the Sun and solar-type stars. The occurrence of this type of intermittency in such models may be of interest in understanding some aspects of such variabilities. (c) 2001 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {Single-point measurements of fluctuations in the scrape-off layer of magnetized plasmas are generally found to be dominated by large-amplitude bursts which are associated with radial motion of bloblike structures. A stochastic model for these fluctuations is presented, with the plasma density given by a random sequence of bursts with a fixed wave form. When the burst events occur in accordance to a Poisson process, this model predicts a parabolic relation between the skewness and kurtosis moments of the plasma fluctuations. In the case of an exponential wave form and exponentially distributed burst amplitudes, the probability density function for the fluctuation amplitudes is shown to be a Gamma distribution with the scale parameter given by the average burst amplitude, and the shape parameter given by the ratio of the burst duration and waiting times.},

abstract = {We formulate and justify rigorously a numerically efficient criterion for the computation of the analyticity breakdown of quasi-periodic solutions in symplectic maps (any dimension) and 1D statistical mechanics models. Depending on the physical interpretation of the model, the analyticity breakdown may correspond to the onset of mobility of dislocations, or of spin waves (in the 1D models) and to the onset of global transport in symplectic twist maps in 2D. The criterion proposed here is based on the blow-up of Sobolev norms of the hull functions. We prove theorems that justify the criterion. These theorems are based on an abstract implicit function theorem, which unifies several results in the literature. The proofs also lead to fast algorithms, which have been implemented and used elsewhere. The method can be adapted to other contexts.},

@article{Galuzio2010a,
abstract = {We show the existence of two-state on-off intermittent behavior in spatially extended dynamical systems, using as an example the damped and forced drift wave equation. The two states are stationary solutions corresponding to different wave energies. In the language of (Fourier-mode) phase space these states are embedded in two invariant manifolds that become transversely unstable in the regime where two-state on-off intermittency sets in. The distribution of laminar duration sizes is compatible with the similar phenomenon occurring in time only in the presence of noise. In an extended system the noisy effect is provided by the spatial modes excited by the perturbation. We show that this intermittency is a precursor of the onset of strong turbulence in the system.},

In particular, the significant role of the forcing frequency is revealed and it is shown that a parabolic resonance mechanism of instability arises in the relevant parameter regime of this model. Numerical experiments demonstrating the different types of chaotic motion which appear in the model are provided.},

A method motivated by the dynamics originally developed for the Navier-Stokes equation is adapted for the KSE. Rigorous error estimates are obtained and compared to those of other methods introduced in the literature. Formal relationships between these other methods and the one introduced here are established. Numerical bifurcation diagrams of the various approximate inertial forms for the KSE are presented. We discuss the correspondence between the rigorous error estimates and the accuracy of the computational results. These methods can be adapted to other dissipative partial differential equations.},

@article{Kirchner2014,
abstract = {Variability indicates motor control disturbances and is suitable to identify gait pathologies. It can be quantified by linear parameters (amplitude estimators) and more sophisticated nonlinear methods (structural information). Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA) is one method to measure structural information, e.g., from stride time series. Recently, an improved method, Adaptive Fractal Analysis (AFA), has been proposed. This method has not been applied to gait data before. Fractal scaling methods (FS) require long stride-to-stride data to obtain valid results. However, in clinical studies, it is not usual to measure a large number of strides (e.g., [Formula: see text][Formula: see text] strides). Amongst others, clinical gait analysis is limited due to short walkways, thus, FS seem to be inapplicable. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate FS under clinical conditions. Stride time data of five self-paced walking trials ([Formula: see text] strides each) of subjects with PD and a healthy control group (CG) was measured. To generate longer time series, stride time sequences were stitched together. The coefficient of variation (CV), fractal scaling exponents [Formula: see text] (DFA) and [Formula: see text] (AFA) were calculated. Two surrogate tests were performed: A) the whole time series was randomly shuffled; B) the single trials were randomly shuffled separately and afterwards stitched together. CV did not discriminate between PD and CG. However, significant differences between PD and CG were found concerning [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text]. Surrogate version B yielded a higher mean squared error and empirical quantiles than version A. Hence, we conclude that the stitching procedure creates an artificial structure resulting in an overestimation of true [Formula: see text]. The method of stitching together sections of gait seems to be appropriate in order to distinguish between PD and CG with FS. It provides an approach to integrate FS as standard in clinical gait analysis and to overcome limitations such as short walkways.},

abstract = {Mathematical models have been central to ecology for nearly a century. Simple models of population dynamics have allowed us to understand fundamental aspects underlying the dynamics and stability of ecological systems. What has remained a challenge, however, is to meaningfully interpret experimental or observational data in light of mathematical models. Here, we review recent developments, notably in the growing field of approximate Bayesian computation (ABC), that allow us to calibrate mathematical models against available data. Estimating the population demographic parameters from data remains a formidable statistical challenge. Here, we attempt to give a flavor and overview of ABC and its applications in population biology and ecology and eschew a detailed technical discussion in favor of a general discussion of the advantages and potential pitfalls this framework offers to population biologists.},

abstract = {A novel method for estimating simultaneously the largest Lyapunov exponent (LLE) and noise level (NL) from a noisy chaotic time series is presented in this paper. We research the influence of noise on the average distance of different pairs of points in an embedding phase space and provide a rescaled formula for calculating the LLE when the time series is contaminated with noise. Our algorithm is proposed based on this formula and the invariant of the LLE in different dimensional embedding phase spaces. With numerical simulation, we find that the proposed method provides a reasonable estimate of the LLE and NL when the NL is less than 10{\%} of the signal content. The comparison with Kantz algorithm shows that our method gives more accurate results of the LLE for the noisy time series. Furthermore, our method is not sensitive to the distribution of the noise.},

@article{Tel2008,
abstract = {Different transient-chaos related phenomena of spatiotemporal systems are reviewed. Special attention is paid to cases where spatiotemporal chaos appears in the form of chaotic transients only. The asymptotic state is then spatially regular. In systems of completely different origins, ranging from fluid dynamics to chemistry and biology, the average lifetimes of these spatiotemporal transients are found, however, to grow rapidly with the system size, often in an exponential fashion. For sufficiently large spatial extension, the lifetime might turn out to be larger than any physically realizable time. There is increasing numerical and experimental evidence that in many systems such transients mask the real attractors. Attractors may then not be relevant to certain types of spatiotemporal chaos, or turbulence. The observable dynamics is governed typically by a high-dimensional chaotic saddle. We review the origin of exponential scaling of the transient lifetime with the system size, and compare this with a similar scaling with system parameters known in low-dimensional problems. The effect of weak noise on such supertransients is discussed. Different crisis phenomena of spatiotemporal systems are presented and fractal properties of the chaotic saddles underlying high-dimensional supertransients are discussed. The recent discovery according to which turbulence in pipe flows is a very long lasting transient sheds new light on chaotic transients in other spatially extended systems. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

One line of work is revealing fundamental architectural features that may cause ecological networks, financial markets, and other complex systems to have tipping points. Another field of research is uncovering generic empirical indicators of the proximity to such critical thresholds. Although sudden shifts in complex systems will inevitably continue to surprise us, work at the crossroads of these emerging fields offers new approaches for anticipating critical transitions.},

abstract = {Changing climatic conditions have led to a significant increase in the magnitude and frequency of extreme rainfall events in the Central Andes of South America. These events are spatially extensive and often result in substantial natural hazards for population, economy and ecology. Here we develop a general framework to predict extreme events by introducing the concept of network divergence on directed networks derived from a non-linear synchronization measure. We apply our method to real-time satellite-derived rainfall data and predict more than 60{\%} (90{\%} during El Ni{\~{n}}o conditions) of rainfall events above the 99th percentile in the Central Andes. In addition to the societal benefits of predicting natural hazards, our study reveals a linkage between polar and tropical regimes as the responsible mechanism: the interplay of northward migrating frontal systems and a low-level wind channel from the western Amazon to the subtropics.},

abstract = {Single-point measurements of fluctuations in the scrape-off layer of magnetized plasmas are generally found to be dominated by large-amplitude bursts which are associated with radial motion of bloblike structures. A stochastic model for these fluctuations is presented, with the plasma density given by a random sequence of bursts with a fixed wave form. When the burst events occur in accordance to a Poisson process, this model predicts a parabolic relation between the skewness and kurtosis moments of the plasma fluctuations. In the case of an exponential wave form and exponentially distributed burst amplitudes, the probability density function for the fluctuation amplitudes is shown to be a Gamma distribution with the scale parameter given by the average burst amplitude, and the shape parameter given by the ratio of the burst duration and waiting times.},

@article{Pecora1997,
abstract = {The field of chaotic synchronization has grown considerably since its advent in 1990. Several subdisciplines and "cottage industries" have emerged that have taken on bona fide lives of their own. Our purpose in this paper is to collect results from these various areas in a review article format with a tutorial emphasis. Fundamentals of chaotic synchronization are reviewed first with emphases on the geometry of synchronization and stability criteria. Several widely used coupling configurations are examined and, when available, experimental demonstrations of their success (generally with chaotic circuit systems) are described. Particular focus is given to the recent notion of synchronous substitution-a method to synchronize chaotic systems using a larger class of scalar chaotic coupling signals than previously thought possible. Connections between this technique and well-known control theory results are also outlined. Extensions of the technique are presented that allow so-called hyperchaotic systems (systems with more than one positive Lyapunov exponent) to be synchronized. Several proposals for "secure" communication schemes have been advanced; major ones are reviewed and their strengths and weaknesses are touched upon. Arrays of coupled chaotic systems have received a great deal of attention lately and have spawned a host of interesting and, in some cases, counterintuitive phenomena including bursting above synchronization thresholds, destabilizing transitions as coupling increases (short-wavelength bifurcations), and riddled basins. In addition, a general mathematical framework for analyzing the stability of arrays with arbitrary coupling configurations is outlined. Finally, the topic of generalized synchronization is discussed, along with data analysis techniques that can be used to decide whether two systems satisfy the mathematical requirements of generalized synchronization.

abstract = {Hyperbolic Lagrangian Coherent Structures (LCSs) are locally most repelling or most attracting material surfaces in a finite-time dynamical system. To identify both types of hyperbolic LCSs at the same time instance, the standard practice has been to compute repelling LCSs from future data and attracting LCSs from past data. This approach tacitly assumes that coherent structures in the flow are fundamentally recurrent, and hence gives inconsistent results for temporally aperiodic systems. Here, we resolve this inconsistency by showing how both repelling and attracting LCSs are computable at the same time instance from a single forward or a single backward run. These LCSs are obtained as surfaces normal to the weakest and strongest eigenvectors of the Cauchy-Green strain tensor.},

When the total energies in wave fields are small, the energy spectra are close to a statistically steady solution of the kinetic equation in the weak turbulence theory. On the other hand, in large-energy wave fields, another self-similar spectrum is found. The coexistence of the weakly nonlinear spectrum in large wave numbers and the strongly nonlinear spectrum in small wave numbers is also found in moderate energy wave fields.},

abstract = {A ridge tracking algorithm for the computation and extraction of Lagrangian coherent structures (LCS) is developed. This algorithm takes advantage of the spatial coherence of LCS by tracking the ridges which form LCS to avoid unnecessary computations away from the ridges. We also make use of the temporal coherence of LCS by approximating the time dependent motion of the LCS with passive tracer particles. To justify this approximation, we provide an estimate of the difference between the motion of the LCS and that of tracer particles which begin on the LCS. In addition to the speedup in computational time, the ridge tracking algorithm uses less memory and results in smaller output files than the standard LCS algorithm. Finally, we apply our ridge tracking algorithm to two test cases, an analytically defined double gyre as well as the more complicated example of the numerical simulation of a swimming jellyfish. In our test cases, we find up to a 35 times speedup when compared with the standard LCS algorithm.},

The error between the model and the true velocity field may result from velocity interpolation, extrapolation, measurement imprecisions, or any other deterministic source. We find that even large velocity errors lead to reliable predictions on Lagrangian coherent structures, as long as the errors remain small in a special time-weighted norm. More specifically, we show how model predictions from the Okubo–Weiss criterion or from finite-time Lyapunov exponents can be validated.We also estimate how close the true Lagrangian coherent structures are to those predicted by models.},

@article{Cristallo2015,
abstract = {Extant chemical evolution models underestimate the Galactic production of Sr, Y and Zr as well as the Solar System abundances of s-only isotopes with 90{\textless}A{\textless}130. To solve this problem, an additional (unknown) process has been invoked, the so-called LEPP (Light Element Primary Process). In this paper we investigate possible alternative solutions. Basing on Full Network Stellar evolutionary calculations, we investigate the effects on the Solar System s-only distribution induced by the inclusion of some commonly ignored physical processes (e.g. rotation) or by the variation of the treatment of convective overshoot, mass-loss and the efficiency of nuclear processes. Our main findings are: 1) at the epoch of the formation of the Solar System, our reference model produces super-solar abundances for the whole s-only distribution, even in the range 90{\textless}A{\textless}130; 2) within errors, the s-only distribution relative to 150Sm is flat; 3) the s-process contribution of the less massive AGB stars (M{\textless}1.5 M{\_}SUN) as well as of the more massive ones (M{\textgreater}4.0 M{\_}SUN) are negligible; 4) the inclusion of rotation implies a downward shift of the whole distribution with an higher efficiency for the heavy s-only isotopes, leading to a flatter s-only distribution; 5) different prescriptions on convection or mass-loss produce nearly rigid shifts of the whole distribution. In summary, a variation of the standard paradigm of AGB nucleosynthesis would allow to reconcile models predictions with Solar System s-only abundances. Nonetheless, the LEPP cannot be definitely ruled out, because of the uncertainties still affecting stellar and Galactic chemical evolution models.},

@article{Crutchfield1988,
abstract = {The statistical hypothesis underlying the "strange attractor" explanation of fluid turbulence is suspect. Spatially extended systems generically exhibit long transients that preclude observation of the behavior governed by the asymptotic invariant measure. Even if the local dynamics is periodic, when it is coupled into a spatial system complex "turbulent" behavior can exist for times that grow faster than exponentially with increasing system volume. The nature of the attractor is irrelevant to the observed behavior when such systems are of even moderate size.},

abstract = {We consider space-periodic evolutionary and travelling-wave solutions to the regularised long-wave equation (RLWE) with damping and forcing. We establish existence, uniqueness and smoothness of the evolutionary solutions for smooth initial conditions, and global in time spatial analyticity of such solutions for analytical initial conditions. The width of the analyticity strip decays at most polynomially. We prove existence of travelling-wave solutions and uniqueness of travelling waves of a sufficiently small norm. The importance of damping is demonstrated by showing that the problem of finding travelling-wave solutions to the undamped RLWE is not well-posed. Finally, we demonstrate the asymptotic convergence of the power series expansion of travelling waves for a weak forcing.},

abstract = {We propose recurrence plots (RPs) to characterize the stickiness of a typical area-preserving map with coexisting chaotic and regular orbits. The difference of the recurrence properties between quasiperiodic and chaotic orbits is revisited, which helps to understand the complex patterns of the corresponding RPs. Moreover, several measures from the recurrence quantification analysis are used to quantify these patterns. Among these measures, the recurrence rate, quantifying the percentage of black points in the plot, is applied to characterize the stickiness of a typical chaotic orbit. The advantage of the recurrence based method in comparison to other standard techniques is that it is possible to distinguish between quasiperiodic and chaotic orbits that are temporarily trapped in a sticky domain, from very short trajectories.},

@article{Chate1999,
abstract = {Completing an earlier work, the 'phase diagram' of the one-dimensional complex Ginzburg-Landau equation is presented. In the Benjamin-Feir stable region, spatiotemporal intermittency regimes are identified which consist of patches of linearly stable plane waves separated by localized objects with a well defined dynamics. The simplest of these structures are shown to be members of a family of exact solutions discovered by Nozaki and Bekki (1985). The problem of the determination of the parameter domain of existence of spatiotemporal intermittency is discussed. In particular, given the inadequacy of the quantities usually measured to determine spatiotemporal disorder, only a rather crude determination of the limit of spatiotemporal intermittency is proposed, awaiting further knowledge on the nature, stability and interactions of the localized objects involved. In the transition region, asymptotic states with an irregular, frozen spatial structure are shown to occur. Finally, the disordered regimes observed in the Benjamin-Feir unstable region are reviewed and argued to be of the spatiotemporal intermittency type in some cases.},

For example, an exact, closed form solution for the nonlinear time evolution of the Kuramoto problem with a Lorentzian oscillator frequency distribution function is obtained. Low dimensional behavior is also demonstrated for several prototypical extensions of the Kuramoto model, and time-delayed coupling is also considered.},

abstract = {Fractal structures are found in biomedical time series from a wide range of physiological phenomena. The multifractal spectrum identifies the deviations in fractal structure within time periods with large and small fluctuations. The present tutorial is an introduction to multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis (MFDFA) that estimates the multifractal spectrum of biomedical time series. The tutorial presents MFDFA step-by-step in an interactive Matlab session. All Matlab tools needed are available in Introduction to MFDFA folder at the website www.ntnu.edu/inm/geri/software. MFDFA are introduced in Matlab code boxes where the reader can employ pieces of, or the entire MFDFA to example time series. After introducing MFDFA, the tutorial discusses the best practice of MFDFA in biomedical signal processing. The main aim of the tutorial is to give the reader a simple self-sustained guide to the implementation of MFDFA and interpretation of the resulting multifractal spectra.},

In the presence of coexisting attractors, a chaotic saddle is born at the basin boundary due to a smooth-fractal metamorphosis. As a control parameter is varied, the chaotic transient evolves to well-developed transient turbulence via a cascade of fractal-fractal metamorphoses. The edge state responsible for the edge of chaos and the genesis of turbulence is an unstable travelling wave in the laboratory frame, corresponding to a saddle point lying at the basin boundary in the Fourier space.},

@misc{Miles1981,
abstract = {The Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation, usually attributed to Korteweg {\&} de Vries (1895), governs the propagation of weakly dispersive, weakly nonlinear water waves and serves as a model equation for any physical system for which the dispersion relation for frequency vs. wavenumber is approximated by $\omega$/k = c0(1 − $\beta$k2) and nonlinearity is weak and quadratic. It first appears explicitly in de Vries's dissertation (1894), although it is implicit in the work of Boussinesq (1872). Its current renaissance stems from the Fermi, Pasta {\&} Ulam (1955) problem for a string of nonlinearly coupled oscillators, which, through the work of Zabusky {\&} Kruskal and their colleagues, led to the discovery of the soliton and the development of inverse-scattering theory by Gardner et al. (1967). Many related evolution equations, each of which represents a balance between some form of dispersion (or variation of dispersion in the case of wave-packet evolution) and weak nonlinearity in an appropriate reference frame, have since been found to have properties analogous to those of the KdV equation - in particular, inverse-scattering solutions that are asymptotically dominated by solitons.},

We argue analytically and confirm numerically that the chaotic dynamics on the synchronization manifold exhibits unstable dimension variability. Unstable dimension variability is a cause of severe modeling difficulty for physical phenomena, since trajectories obtained from the mathematical model may not be related to trajectories of the actual system. We present and example of unstable dimension variability occurring in a system of two coupled chaotic maps, considering the dynamics in the synchronization manifold and its corresponding transversal direction, where a tongue-like structure is formed. The unstable dimension variability is revealed in the statistical distribution of the finite-time transversal Lyapunov exponent, having both negative and positive values.},

abstract = {We study a transition to hyperchaos in the two-dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes equations with periodic boundary conditions and an external forcing term. Bifurcation diagrams are constructed by varying the Reynolds number, and a transition to hyperchaos (HC) is identified. Before the onset of HC, there is coexistence of two chaotic attractors and a hyperchaotic saddle. After the transition to HC, the two chaotic attractors merge with the hyperchaotic saddle, generating random switching between chaos and hyperchaos, which is responsible for intermittent bursts in the time series of energy and enstrophy. The chaotic mixing properties of the flow are characterized by detecting Lagrangian coherent structures. After the transition to HC, the flow displays complex Lagrangian patterns and an increase in the level of Lagrangian chaoticity during the bursty periods that can be predicted statistically by the hyperchaotic saddle prior to HC transition.},

abstract = {We show the existence of two-state on-off intermittent behavior in spatially extended dynamical systems, using as an example the damped and forced drift wave equation. The two states are stationary solutions corresponding to different wave energies. In the language of (Fourier-mode) phase space these states are embedded in two invariant manifolds that become transversely unstable in the regime where two-state on-off intermittency sets in. The distribution of laminar duration sizes is compatible with the similar phenomenon occurring in time only in the presence of noise. In an extended system the noisy effect is provided by the spatial modes excited by the perturbation. We show that this intermittency is a precursor of the onset of strong turbulence in the system.},

abstract = {The poor expression of Plasmodium falciparum proteins in heterologous systems and the difficulty in obtaining sufficient material directly from the parasite have limited the experimental characterization of many of the approximately 5200 proteins encoded by this organism. To improve the expression of P. falciparum proteins in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we selected yeast ura3 mutants that acquired the ability to utilize the P. falciparum orthologue (PfOMPDC) of URA3 to grow on media lacking uracil. Two of these mutant strains, BY{\#}29 and PJ{\#}17, expressed up to 100-fold more of four P. falciparum proteins as a result of mutations in either HRP1 or KAP104, respectively. These mutations, as well as a temperature-sensitive rna15 mutation, likely decrease the efficiency of mRNA 3' end formation and produce longer mRNAs of P. falciparum genes. These yeast strains may be useful for the analysis and purification of P. falciparum proteins.},

abstract = {Problems associated with large-scale pattern growth of graphene constitute one of the main obstacles to using this material in device applications. Recently, macroscopic-scale graphene films were prepared by two-dimensional assembly of graphene sheets chemically derived from graphite crystals and graphene oxides. However, the sheet resistance of these films was found to be much larger than theoretically expected values. Here we report the direct synthesis of large-scale graphene films using chemical vapour deposition on thin nickel layers, and present two different methods of patterning the films and transferring them to arbitrary substrates. The transferred graphene films show very low sheet resistance of approximately 280 Omega per square, with approximately 80 per cent optical transparency. At low temperatures, the monolayers transferred to silicon dioxide substrates show electron mobility greater than 3,700 cm(2) V(-1) s(-1) and exhibit the half-integer quantum Hall effect, implying that the quality of graphene grown by chemical vapour deposition is as high as mechanically cleaved graphene. Employing the outstanding mechanical properties of graphene, we also demonstrate the macroscopic use of these highly conducting and transparent electrodes in flexible, stretchable, foldable electronics.},

abstract = {The method for stabilizing an unstable periodic orbit in chaotic dynamical systems originally formulated by Ott, Grebogi, and Yorke (OGY) is not directly applicable to chaotic Hamiltonian systems. The reason is that an unstable periodic orbit in such systems often exhibits complex-conjugate eigenvalues at one or more of its orbit points. In this paper we extend the OGY stabilization method to control Hamiltonian chaos by incorporating the notion of stable and unstable directions at each periodic point. We also present an algorithm to calculate the stable and unstable directions. Other issues specific to the control of Hamiltonian chaos are also discussed.},

@article{Ott1994,
abstract = {We consider situations where a nonlinear dynamical system possesses a smooth invariant manifold. For parameter values p less than a critical value pc, the invariant manifold has within it a chaotic attractor of the system. As p increases through pc a blowout bifurcation takes place, in which the former attraction to the manifold changes to repulsion, and the chaotic set in the manifold ceases to be an attractor of the system. Depending on the dynamics away from the manifold, blowout bifurcations can be either hysteretic or nonhysteretic, and they are correspondingly accompanied either by riddled basins (in which the basin is a “fat fractal”) or by an extreme form of temporally intermittent bursting recently called on-off intermittency. The role of the dynamics away from the manifold in determining the hysteretic or supercritical nature of the bifurcation is explicitly illustrated with a numerical example.},

abstract = {The transition to intermittent mean--field dynamos is studied using numerical simulations of isotropic magnetohydrodynamic turbulence driven by a helical flow. The low-Prandtl number regime is investigated by keeping the kinematic viscosity fixed while the magnetic diffusivity is varied. Just below the critical parameter value for the onset of dynamo action, a transient mean--field with low magnetic energy is observed. After the transition to a sustained dynamo, the system is shown to evolve through different types of intermittency until a large--scale coherent field with small--scale turbulent fluctuations is formed. Prior to this coherent field stage, a new type of intermittency is detected, where the magnetic field randomly alternates between phases of coherent and incoherent large--scale spatial structures. The relevance of these findings to the understanding of the physics of mean--field dynamo and the physical mechanisms behind intermittent behavior observed in stellar magnetic field variability are discussed.},

abstract = {A coupled map lattice for convection is proposed, which consists of Eulerian and Lagrangian procedures. Simulations of the model not only reproduce a wide-range of phenomena in Rayleigh-B$\backslash$'{\{}e{\}}nard convection experiments but also lead to several prediction of novel phenomena there: For small aspect ratios, the formation of convective rolls, their oscillation, many routes to chaos, and chaotic itinerancy are found, with the increase of the Rayleigh number. For large aspect ratios, the collective oscillation of convective rolls, travelling waves, coherent chaos, and spatiotemporal intermittency are observed. At high Rayleigh numbers, the transition from soft to hard turbulence is confirmed, as is characterized by the change of the temperature distribution from Gaussian to exponential. Roll formation in three-dimensional convection is also simulated, and found to reproduce experiments well.},

abstract = {Problems associated with large-scale pattern growth of graphene constitute one of the main obstacles to using this material in device applications. Recently, macroscopic-scale graphene films were prepared by two-dimensional assembly of graphene sheets chemically derived from graphite crystals and graphene oxides. However, the sheet resistance of these films was found to be much larger than theoretically expected values. Here we report the direct synthesis of large-scale graphene films using chemical vapour deposition on thin nickel layers, and present two different methods of patterning the films and transferring them to arbitrary substrates. The transferred graphene films show very low sheet resistance of approximately 280 Omega per square, with approximately 80 per cent optical transparency. At low temperatures, the monolayers transferred to silicon dioxide substrates show electron mobility greater than 3,700 cm(2) V(-1) s(-1) and exhibit the half-integer quantum Hall effect, implying that the quality of graphene grown by chemical vapour deposition is as high as mechanically cleaved graphene. Employing the outstanding mechanical properties of graphene, we also demonstrate the macroscopic use of these highly conducting and transparent electrodes in flexible, stretchable, foldable electronics.},

@article{Search1993,
abstract = {In this paper, we numerically investigate the fraction of nonhyperbolic parameter values in chaotic dynamical systems. By a nonhyperbolic parameter value we mean a panmeter value at which there are tangencies between some stable and unstable manifolds. The nonhyperbolic parameter values are h p o m t because the dynamics in such cases is especially pathological. For example, near each such parameter value, there is another parameter value at which there are infinitely many coexisting amctors. In particular, Newhouse and Robinson proved that the existence of one nonhyperbolic parameter value typidy implies the existence of an interval (‘a Newhouse interval') of nonhyperbolic parameter values. We numerically compute the fraction of nonhyperbolic parameter values for the Henon map in Ihe parameter range .where there exist only chaotic saddles (i.e., nonamcting invariant chaotic sets). We discuss a theoretical model which predias the fraction of nonhyperbolic parameter values for small Jacobians. Two-dimensional diffeomorphisms with similar chaotic saddles may arise in the study of Poincar6 rem map for physical systems. Ow results suggest that (1) nonhyperbolic chaotic saddles am common in chaotic dynamical systems: and (2) Newhouse intervals can be quite large in the parameter space.},

@article{Boettiger2012,
abstract = {Early warning signals have been proposed to forecast the possibility of a critical transition, such as the eutrophication of a lake, the collapse of a coral reef or the end of a glacial period. Because such transitions often unfold on temporal and spatial scales that can be difficult to approach by experimental manipulation, research has often relied on historical observations as a source of natural experiments. Here, we examine a critical difference between selecting systems for study based on the fact that we have observed a critical transition and those systems for which we wish to forecast the approach of a transition. This difference arises by conditionally selecting systems known to experience a transition of some sort and failing to account for the bias this introduces--a statistical error often known as the prosecutor's fallacy. By analysing simulated systems that have experienced transitions purely by chance, we reveal an elevated rate of false-positives in common warning signal statistics. We further demonstrate a model-based approach that is less subject to this bias than those more commonly used summary statistics. We note that experimental studies with replicates avoid this pitfall entirely.},

@article{Xu2014,
abstract = {The statistical properties of turbulence differ in an essential way from those of systems in or near thermal equilibrium because of the flux of energy between vastly different scales at which energy is supplied and at which it is dissipated. We elucidate this difference by studying experimentally and numerically the fluctuations of the energy of a small fluid particle moving in a turbulent fluid. We demonstrate how the fundamental property of detailed balance is broken, so that the probabilities of forward and backward transitions are not equal for turbulence. In physical terms, we found that in a large set of flow configurations, fluid elements decelerate faster than accelerate, a feature known all too well from driving in dense traffic. The statistical signature of rare "flight-crash" events, associated with fast particle deceleration, provides a way to quantify irreversibility in a turbulent flow. Namely, we find that the third moment of the power fluctuations along a trajectory, nondimensionalized by the energy flux, displays a remarkable power law as a function of the Reynolds number, both in two and in three spatial dimensions. This establishes a relation between the irreversibility of the system and the range of active scales. We speculate that the breakdown of the detailed balance characterized here is a general feature of other systems very far from equilibrium, displaying a wide range of spatial scales.},

We show that our approach can be easily extended to other types of periodic forces, including the square wave.},

Appropriate solitary wave solutions applying to propagation in optical fibers and optical fiber amplifiers with these distributed parameters have also been studied. These solutions exist for physically realistic dispersion and nonlinearity profiles in a fiber with anomalous group velocity dispersion. They correspond either to compressing or spreading solitary pulses which maintain a linear chirp or to chirped oscillatory solutions. The stability of these solutions has been confirmed by numerical simulations of the NLSE.},

abstract = {K-theory provides a framework for classifying Ramond-Ramond (RR) charges and fields. K-theory of manifolds has a natural extension to K-theory of noncommutative algebras, such as the algebra considered in noncommutative Yang-Mills theory or in open string field theory. In a number of concrete problems, the K-theory analysis proceeds most naturally if one starts out with an infinite set of D-branes, reduced by tachyon condensation to a finite set. This suggests that string field theory should be reconsidered for N=infinity.},

@article{Robinson1995,
abstract = {Dissipative partial differential equations have applications throughout the sciences: models of turbulence in fluids, chemical reactions, and morphogenesis in biology can all be written in a general form which allows them to be subjected to a unified analysis. Recent results on these equations show that in many cases they are not as complex as they initially appear, and can be converted into a set of ordinary differential equations. However, most of the relevant references present a bewildering array of terms which can obscure the simple underlying ideas. The main purpose of this paper is to introduce this terminology, motivated by several major results, slowly and by example. Detailed proofs are omitted, but it is hoped that this approach will give a good understanding of and intuitive feel for the subject without recourse to technicalities. Nevertheless, sufficient mathematical detail is included to allow application of these results to many examples. (c) 1995 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {The ion-ion beam instability is experimentally studied just above threshold in a laboratory double-plasma device. Intermittent bursts of unstable waves are recorded in the target plasma and the distribution of the recurrence times of the bursts is estimated. At the onset of instability, the measurements are in agreement with the expected evolution deduced from a theoretical model that combines the normal form of a supercritical Hopf-Andronov bifurcation and the parametric noisy deviations from threshold typical of on-off intermittency. In both the experiment and the model, the distribution of the recurrence times of the bursts decays as an inverse power law and the evolution of the mean laminar length when the control parameter is increased beyond threshold exhibits a power law of exponent -1.},

abstract = {Using the recently developed variational theory of hyperbolic Lagrangian coherent structures (LCSs), we introduce a computational approach that renders attracting and repelling LCSs as smooth, parametrized curves in two-dimensional flows. The curves are obtained as trajectories of an autonomous ordinary differential equation for the tensor lines of the Cauchy-Green strain tensor. This approach eliminates false positives and negatives in LCS detection by separating true exponential stretching from shear in a frame-independent fashion. Having an explicitly parametrized form for hyperbolic LCSs also allows for their further in-depth analysis and accurate advection as material lines. We illustrate these results on a kinematic model flow and on a direct numerical simulation of two-dimensional turbulence.},

abstract = {Over the last years, fractal and multifractal geometries were applied extensively in many medical signal (1D, 2D or 3D) analysis applications like pattern recognition, texture analysis and segmentation. Application of this geometry relies heavily on the estimation of the fractal features. Various methods were proposed to estimate the fractal dimension or multifractal spectral of a signal. This article presents an overview of these algorithms, the way they work, their benefits and their limits. The aim of this review is to explain and to categorize the various algorithms into groups and their application in the field of medical signal analysis.},

abstract = {This paper presents a methodology to study the role played by nonattracting chaotic sets called chaotic saddles in chaotic transitions of high-dimensional dynamical systems. Our methodology is applied to the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, a reaction-diffusion partial differential equation. The paper describes a novel technique that uses the stable manifold of a chaotic saddle to characterize the homoclinic tangency responsible for an interior crisis, a chaotic transition that results in the enlargement of a chaotic attractor. The numerical techniques explained here are important to improve the understanding of the connection between low-dimensional chaotic systems and spatiotemporal systems which exhibit temporal chaos and spatial coherence.},
