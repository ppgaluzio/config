In the presence of coexisting attractors, a chaotic saddle is born at the basin boundary due to a smooth-fractal metamorphosis. As a control parameter is varied, the chaotic transient evolves to well-developed transient turbulence via a cascade of fractal-fractal metamorphoses. The edge state responsible for the edge of chaos and the genesis of turbulence is an unstable travelling wave in the laboratory frame, corresponding to a saddle point lying at the basin boundary in the Fourier space.},

abstract = {We study a transition to hyperchaos in the two-dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes equations with periodic boundary conditions and an external forcing term. Bifurcation diagrams are constructed by varying the Reynolds number, and a transition to hyperchaos (HC) is identified. Before the onset of HC, there is coexistence of two chaotic attractors and a hyperchaotic saddle. After the transition to HC, the two chaotic attractors merge with the hyperchaotic saddle, generating random switching between chaos and hyperchaos, which is responsible for intermittent bursts in the time series of energy and enstrophy. The chaotic mixing properties of the flow are characterized by detecting Lagrangian coherent structures. After the transition to HC, the flow displays complex Lagrangian patterns and an increase in the level of Lagrangian chaoticity during the bursty periods that can be predicted statistically by the hyperchaotic saddle prior to HC transition.},

abstract = {Dissipative partial differential equations have applications throughout the sciences: models of turbulence in fluids, chemical reactions, and morphogenesis in biology can all be written in a general form which allows them to be subjected to a unified analysis. Recent results on these equations show that in many cases they are not as complex as they initially appear, and can be converted into a set of ordinary differential equations. However, most of the relevant references present a bewildering array of terms which can obscure the simple underlying ideas. The main purpose of this paper is to introduce this terminology, motivated by several major results, slowly and by example. Detailed proofs are omitted, but it is hoped that this approach will give a good understanding of and intuitive feel for the subject without recourse to technicalities. Nevertheless, sufficient mathematical detail is included to allow application of these results to many examples. (c) 1995 American Institute of Physics.},

@article{Tel2008,
abstract = {Different transient-chaos related phenomena of spatiotemporal systems are reviewed. Special attention is paid to cases where spatiotemporal chaos appears in the form of chaotic transients only. The asymptotic state is then spatially regular. In systems of completely different origins, ranging from fluid dynamics to chemistry and biology, the average lifetimes of these spatiotemporal transients are found, however, to grow rapidly with the system size, often in an exponential fashion. For sufficiently large spatial extension, the lifetime might turn out to be larger than any physically realizable time. There is increasing numerical and experimental evidence that in many systems such transients mask the real attractors. Attractors may then not be relevant to certain types of spatiotemporal chaos, or turbulence. The observable dynamics is governed typically by a high-dimensional chaotic saddle. We review the origin of exponential scaling of the transient lifetime with the system size, and compare this with a similar scaling with system parameters known in low-dimensional problems. The effect of weak noise on such supertransients is discussed. Different crisis phenomena of spatiotemporal systems are presented and fractal properties of the chaotic saddles underlying high-dimensional supertransients are discussed. The recent discovery according to which turbulence in pipe flows is a very long lasting transient sheds new light on chaotic transients in other spatially extended systems. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

These events are spatially extensive and often result in substantial natural hazards for population, economy and ecology. Here we develop a general framework to predict extreme events by introducing the concept of network divergence on directed networks derived from a non-linear synchronization measure. We apply our method to real-time satellite-derived rainfall data and predict more than 60\% (90\% during El Ni\~{n}o conditions) of rainfall events above the 99th percentile in the Central Andes. In addition to the societal benefits of predicting natural hazards, our study reveals a linkage between polar and tropical regimes as the responsible mechanism: the interplay of northward migrating frontal systems and a low-level wind channel from the western Amazon to the subtropics.},

abstract = {Completing an earlier work, the 'phase diagram' of the one-dimensional complex Ginzburg-Landau equation is presented. In the Benjamin-Feir stable region, spatiotemporal intermittency regimes are identified which consist of patches of linearly stable plane waves separated by localized objects with a well defined dynamics. The simplest of these structures are shown to be members of a family of exact solutions discovered by Nozaki and Bekki (1985). The problem of the determination of the parameter domain of existence of spatiotemporal intermittency is discussed. In particular, given the inadequacy of the quantities usually measured to determine spatiotemporal disorder, only a rather crude determination of the limit of spatiotemporal intermittency is proposed, awaiting further knowledge on the nature, stability and interactions of the localized objects involved. In the transition region, asymptotic states with an irregular, frozen spatial structure are shown to occur. Finally, the disordered regimes observed in the Benjamin-Feir unstable region are reviewed and argued to be of the spatiotemporal intermittency type in some cases.},

abstract = {We evaluate several alternative methods for the approximation of inertial manifolds for the one-dimensional Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation (KSE). A method motivated by the dynamics originally developed for the Navier-Stokes equation is adapted for the KSE. Rigorous error estimates are obtained and compared to those of other methods introduced in the literature. Formal relationships between these other methods and the one introduced here are established. Numerical bifurcation diagrams of the various approximate inertial forms for the KSE are presented. We discuss the correspondence between the rigorous error estimates and the accuracy of the computational results. These methods can be adapted to other dissipative partial differential equations.},

abstract = {An aspect of the synchronization dynamics is investigated in this work. We argue analytically and confirm numerically that the chaotic dynamics on the synchronization manifold exhibits unstable dimension variability. Unstable dimension variability is a cause of severe modeling difficulty for physical phenomena, since trajectories obtained from the mathematical model may not be related to trajectories of the actual system. We present and example of unstable dimension variability occurring in a system of two coupled chaotic maps, considering the dynamics in the synchronization manifold and its corresponding transversal direction, where a tongue-like structure is formed. The unstable dimension variability is revealed in the statistical distribution of the finite-time transversal Lyapunov exponent, having both negative and positive values.},

abstract = {Single-point measurements of fluctuations in the scrape-off layer of magnetized plasmas are generally found to be dominated by large-amplitude bursts which are associated with radial motion of bloblike structures. A stochastic model for these fluctuations is presented, with the plasma density given by a random sequence of bursts with a fixed wave form. When the burst events occur in accordance to a Poisson process, this model predicts a parabolic relation between the skewness and kurtosis moments of the plasma fluctuations. In the case of an exponential wave form and exponentially distributed burst amplitudes, the probability density function for the fluctuation amplitudes is shown to be a Gamma distribution with the scale parameter given by the average burst amplitude, and the shape parameter given by the ratio of the burst duration and waiting times.},

abstract = {The transition to turbulence via spatiotemporal intermittency is investigated in the context of coupled maps defined on small-world networks. The local dynamics is given by the Chat\'{e}-Manneville minimal map previously used in studies of spatiotemporal intermittency in ordered lattice. The critical boundary separating laminar and turbulent regimes is calculated on the parameter space of the system, given by the coupling strength and the rewiring probability of the network. Windows of relaminarization are present in some regions of the parameter space. New features arise in small-world networks; for instance, the character of the transition to turbulence changes from second-order to a first-order phase transition at some critical value of the rewiring probability. A linear relation characterizing the change in the order of the phase transition is found. The global quantity used as order parameter for the transition also exhibits nontrivial collective behavior for some values of the parameters. These models may describe several processes occurring in nonuniform media where the degree of disorder can be continuously varied through a parameter.},

@article{Chate1994,
abstract = {Completing an earlier work, the 'phase diagram' of the one-dimensional complex Ginzburg-Landau equation is presented. In the Benjamin-Feir stable region, spatiotemporal intermittency regimes are identified which consist of patches of linearly stable plane waves separated by localized objects with a well defined dynamics. The simplest of these structures are shown to be members of a family of exact solutions discovered by Nozaki and Bekki (1985). The problem of the determination of the parameter domain of existence of spatiotemporal intermittency is discussed. In particular, given the inadequacy of the quantities usually measured to determine spatiotemporal disorder, only a rather crude determination of the limit of spatiotemporal intermittency is proposed, awaiting further knowledge on the nature, stability and interactions of the localized objects involved. In the transition region, asymptotic states with an irregular, frozen spatial structure are shown to occur. Finally, the disordered regimes observed in the Benjamin-Feir unstable region are reviewed and argued to be of the spatiotemporal intermittency type in some cases.},

abstract="Metaheuristics are general algorithmic frameworks, often nature-inspired, designed to solve complex optimization problems, and they are a growing research area since a few decades. In recent years, metaheuristics are emerging as successful alternatives to more classical approaches also for solving optimization problems that include in their mathematical formulation uncertain, stochastic, and dynamic information. In this paper metaheuristics such as Ant Colony Optimization, Evolutionary Computation, Simulated Annealing, Tabu Search and others are introduced, and their applications to the class of Stochastic Combinatorial Optimization Problems (SCOPs) is thoroughly reviewed. Issues common to all metaheuristics, open problems, and possible directions of research are proposed and discussed. In this survey, the reader familiar to metaheuristics finds also pointers to classical algorithmic approaches to optimization under uncertainty, and useful informations to start working on this problem domain, while the reader new to metaheuristics should find a good tutorial in those metaheuristics that are currently being applied to optimization under uncertainty, and motivations for interest in this field.",

abstract="In recent years, several researchers have concentrated on using probabilistic models in evolutionary algorithms. These Estimation Distribution Algorithms (EDA) incorporate methods for automated learning of correlations between variables of the encoded solutions. The process of sampling new individuals from a probabilistic model respects these mutual dependencies such that disruption of important building blocks is avoided, in comparison with classical recombination operators. The goal of this paper is to investigate the usefulness of this concept in multi-objective optimization, where the aim is to approximate the set of Pareto-optimal solutions. We integrate the model building and sampling techniques of a special EDA called Bayesian Optimization Algorithm, based on binary decision trees, into an evolutionary multi-objective optimizer using a special selection scheme. The behavior of the resulting Bayesian Multi-objective Optimization Algorithm (BMOA) is empirically investigated on the multi-objective knapsack problem.",
